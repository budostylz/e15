## Features

 1. You will be able to order drinks from two bartenders Shaun and Fernando. 
 
 2. When you create an order and click <em>Review Your Order Status</em> in the navigation, your order will not appear. You will have to login either as Shaun or Fernando to process your order. After the 
 order is processed, you will be able to see your order.

3. It's better to sign in as either Shaun or Fernando since they can order drinks, process their order and review their order confirmation. The bartenders have no limits on what they can see in the navigation.
