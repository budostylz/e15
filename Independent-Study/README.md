## Webpack or Laravel Mix? That is the question.

Dynamic web applications require front-end technologies where browser speed and optimization of an application's 
assets(css, image, font files, etc) are crucial. This research will focus on using technology to compile, bundle and map
front-end assets to optimize web applications. First we will review web pack and demo a simple web application to understand the concept. Next, we will demo a basic application using Laravel Mix which uses webpack under the hood to capture the concept of optimizing Laravel web applications.
