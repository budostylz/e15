## (StandAlone) Webpack or Laravel Mix?

*By: Shaun Lewis*

Dynamic web applications require front-end technologies where browser speed and optimization of an application's 
assets(css, image, font files, etc) are crucial. This research will focus on using technology to compile, bundle and map
front-end assets to optimize web applications. First we will review web pack and demo a simple web application to understand the concept. Next, we will demo a basic application using Laravel Mix which uses webpack under the hood to capture the concept of optimizing Laravel web applications. Finally, we'll compare the two approches (stand alone Webpack or Laravel Mix) to get a better idea of which approach to use when building Laravel applications.

# Webpack Demo

## Configuration

### Lets start with our Previous p1 project below.
![p1](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image00PNG.PNG)

### The first step is downloading node.js. You can type the following commands in your terminal to see if it's on your system.

```ubuntu
node -v
npm -v

```

![node check](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/checknode.PNG)

### If you don't see either the node or npm version above, download node js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will direct to the node site.
![node site](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image0.PNG)

### Currently this is p1 project structure.
![project structure](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image1.1.PNG)

### Looking at out `index.php` file we see the following css and script assets:


![before](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/before.PNG)

### We'll create a new package.json in our project with the following command.

```ubuntu
npm init -y

```

### You should see the output below.
![package.json](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image3.PNG)

### Our package.json is created in our project below.
![package.json](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image4.PNG)

### Next we'll install our node dependencies and our `webpack`.
```ubuntu
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

```
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image5.PNG)

### Our node modules with our `webpack` packages are installed. 
### You can dive within the the `node_modules` directory to confirm your `webpack` packages or view the `package.json `dev-dependencies.

![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image6.PNG)

![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image7.PNG)

### Let's turn to our `package.json`, add/set `private` property to `true`, finally removing our `main` property since we'll define that in our `webpack.config.js` in the next steps.
### Setting `private` to true prevents npm from [publishing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7314849/what-is-purpose-of-the-property-private-in-package-json) it.
### The `main` property defines our entry point for our assets build.
![package.json](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image11.PNG)

### We're going to add a scripts property to define our [life cycle](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#scripts) build scripts.
### The `develop` and `build` scripts are the ones that we will use in the next steps.

![package.json](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/scripts.PNG)




### Let us do some clean up and changes to our project directory structure.
### Next we'll create our `src` and `dist` folders.
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image8.PNG)

### The `src` folder will serve as our entry point for webpack to locate our assets. 
### The `dist` folder will serve as our output build for our assets. 
### Webpack calls this neat concept the [dependency graph](https://webpack.js.org/).

## JavaScript Assets

### We'll move `hideResults.js` to our `src` folder. 
### Remove `jquery-3.4.1.min.js`, since we'll be referencing jQuery from the `node_modules` in the following steps.
### We can get rid of the js folder since we'll no longer need it.
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image9.PNG)

### We'll remove the JavaScript assets from our `index.php`.
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image10.PNG)

### Lets install jquery to our node_modules and confirm jQuery dependency within our `package.json`.

```ubuntu
  npm install jquery

```
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image12.PNG)

![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image13.1.PNG)

### We'll import jQuery into our `hideResults.js` file.
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image14.PNG)


## webpack.config.js

### We're going to create our `webpack.config.js` file which will map our assets and builds.
### Create a `webpack.config.js` file at the root directory
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/js/image14.1.PNG)

### Within `webpack.config.js` we'll write the following code.

```javascript
const path = require('path') //node module for working with your application's file paths

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/hideResults.js', //entry point for our asset builds
    output: {
        filename: 'main.js',//output file for our assets build
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist') //defining our output directory for our output file build
    }
}


```

### Next type in the following command in your terminal



```ubuntu
npm run develop
```

### Look for the following output within your terminal.
![node dependencies and webpack](https://github.com/budostylz/e15/blob/master/Independent-Study/images/webpack-standalone/devbuild.PNG)

### `Asset` represents your output bundle file located in the `dist` directory
### `Size`  represents the size of the bundle file.
### `Chunks` and `Chunk Names` represents our complete assets. Right now our chunk is called main because we define one output file `main` and one entry file `hideResults` within `web.config.js`.
### You can define more assets as entry points within `web.config.js`. This is called [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/).
